The ibeacon driver uses a BLE4 module [HM-17](https://www.herman-shop.com/PDF/bluetooth%20hm16%20hm17.pdf) (HM-16 should also work) which is capable of bluetooth central role  
it is driven by AT cmds so there may be other compatible modules too.

Working with hte HM-17 Module with the Firmware Version V120 and V110
The HM-10 Module with flasehd Firmware (https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/how-to-flash-the-firmware-on-cloned-hm-10-ble-module-using-arduino-uno) worked too with the Firmware V609.
When the ESP or HM Module wont boot up, switch the connection to TX-TX and RX-RX and Switch it in the Tasmota Config.

all apple compatible ibeacon devices should work as beacons. this one is fully apple compatible and the battery lasts about a year [NRF51822 ibeacon module](https://cleanuri.com/KYzMAv)

another special beacon is supported. it has a build in speaker and can be made beeping by mqtt cmd. the battery however lasts only about a month [smart-tag](https://www.ebay.de/itm/Smart-Tag-GPS-Tracker-Bluetooth-Anti-verlorene-Alarm-Key-Finder-Haustier-Kind/192587529819?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20190212102350%26meid%3Df9a325be14f84f9c9b09eda9217da1d2%26pid%3D100012%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D132960074783%26itm%3D192587529819%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675&_trksid=p2047675.c100012.m1985)

the hm17 is connected to GND , 3.3 V, RX to TX of ESP and TX to RX of ESP. 
the module when delivered is in the peripheral mode and must be switched to central mode only once by the cmds
sensor52 1 and sensor52 2. the settings are stored inside the module.

sensor52 us  sets the (update) scanning interval in seconds s  (5....n)
sensor52 ts  sets the timeout interval in seconds s  (10....n)

the driver reports all beacons found during a scan with its ID and RSSI.
if the beacon can no longer be found during scan and the timeout interval has passed the beacons RSSI is set to zero (0)

a beacon with beeper can made beeping by setting RSSI to 99 by MQTT cmd.
